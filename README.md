Ethereum Lottery (Ropsten)

How to play:

1) Send 0.2 ether (exact) to address 0x20b8c246DCaF8Dd2c739A49c02D0dDfC752C1c07
	1a) If you send more or less than 0.2 ether, the contract will reject the transaction
2) After 5 people have sent 0.2 ether, the contract chooses one address at random and sends 0.8 ethers to it + 0.2 ethers to Give Directly's address
3) The lottery restarts

I'm a terrible developer! Doing this for fun and to understand ethereum. Any suggestions to the code are highly encouraged and recommended.

Smart contract code is in the /contracts directory
