Ethereum Lottery

How to play:

1) Send 1 ether (exact) to address 0x20b8c246DCaF8Dd2c739A49c02D0dDfC752C1c07
2) After 5 people have sent one ether, the contract chooses one address at random and sends the 5 ethers to that account
3) The lottery restarts

I'm a terrible developer! Doing this for fun and to understand ethereum. Any suggestions to the code are highly encouraged and recommended.

Smart contract code is in the /contracts directory
